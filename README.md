# Android Intern Task App

This application is designed as a hands-on project for Android interns to build a clean, user-friendly mobile application. It focuses on implementing essential features such as user authentication (Sign Up and Sign In), OTP verification, and a functional dashboard.

## Features

* **Splash Screen:** A simple splash screen with the app logo.
* **User Authentication:** Clean Sign Up and Sign In screens with input validation.
* **OTP Verification:** A 6-digit OTP verification screen with a 2-minute countdown timer and a resend option.
* **Dashboard:** A functional dashboard with bottom navigation for Home, Notifications, and Settings.
* **Modular Design:** Each screen is implemented using separate fragments for a modular and organized architecture.

## Dummy Data Notice

Please note that this application uses **dummy data** for demonstration purposes. You can use any email and password combination to sign in or sign up. Similarly, any 6-digit number will be accepted as a valid OTP. This is to showcase the UI flow without a backend implementation.
